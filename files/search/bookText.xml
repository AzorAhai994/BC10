           When you hear the word teams, what is

           your first thought?



           Two words that come to my mind: energy and
           diversity. Energy is what people

           create when they come for a


           purpose to deliver value. Diver-

           isty is a combination of different strengths,
           backgrounds, ideas, opinions  that  helps
           to create a better and stronger energy to

           achieve the required purpose.


           How do you recognize the talented one

           within the team?


           All of us have own and unique talents and

           strengths, which we develop. The first ques-

           People rarely internalize inspirational words,

           ACTIVATE THEIR LEADERSHIP



           Avoid extrinsic motivators, and start activat-
           ing the leadership in everyone around you.
           Activating their leadership will  mean their
           actions will be grounded in conditions that

           are more likely to produce the outcomes you
           want.  Doing so will increase your organ-
           izations capacity and ability to respond to
           whatever happens in your world.



           Often leaders respond to problems by ad-
           dressing skills, knowledge, and tools. While
           all  are  important, too often, leaders  fail  to

           examine the conditions leading to how the
           people respond to problems.  After all, it’s
           people’s response to problems that will im-
           prove things, so imagine if all of them were

           responding as leaders.


           Activating their  leadership starts  with ob-
           servations,  which means  seeing  people’s

           responses without judging them as good or
           bad. When you can observe what’s happen-
           ing without judgement, you can start to un-
           derstand their motivations.



           Motivation is, by definition, a person’s rea-
           son to act. Once you think you understand
           their motivations, it can be tempting to dis-
